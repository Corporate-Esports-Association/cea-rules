### CEA RL Season Format Overview
- **Regular Season**: Two stages: a 4-week Swiss followed by a 3-week Swiss bracket.
- **Playoffs**: Top teams compete in a single-elimination tournament. Some matches may be cast on the [CEA_RL Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/CEA_RL). Grand Finals will be broadcast live on Twitch, with schedules announced at the start of playoffs.
- **Weekly Structure**: Matchups announced on Mondays. Each team plays one match per week, with results due by Sunday at 9 PM Pacific (observing Daylight Saving Time). For rescheduling, contact the opposing captain per the ‘Match Rescheduling’ section.

## II. Team Rules Overview

### Player Eligibility
- Players must have access to Rocket League on PC (Steam or Epic), PS4, Xbox One, or Switch.
- Only registered team members may play under their own account. Game-banned accounts render the player banned, and switching accounts to bypass bans is prohibited.

### Team Roster
- Teams start with 3–8 players. See CEA General Rules for roster qualifications.
- After Week 1, players cannot transfer to another roster within the same company for Rocket League without Game Lead approval.
- Companies with multiple teams may have players on multiple rosters per CEA General Rules (“Team Eligibility”). Floaters are not considered transfers.
- After Week 4, removing players does not free up roster spots.

### Floaters
- A player may play on multiple rosters within the same company and game, with restrictions:
  - Teams must meet minimum size without counting shared players.
  - Shared players count toward maximum roster size.
  - A player on multiple rosters may only play for one team per week. Violations result in forfeits and potential disqualification.
  - Companies must inform the Game Lead of floater rosters and weekly team assignments.
- Floater limits:
  - 2–3 teams: 1 floater
  - 4–6 teams: 2 floaters
  - 7–9 teams: 3 floaters
- Each floater may be on up to 3 rosters; each team may have up to 2 floaters.

### Cross-Game Policy
- Players are discouraged from playing multiple games within the same company. Game Leads may allow this at their discretion. Other teams are not required to accommodate scheduling conflicts due to other games.

### Half-Team / Joint-Team Policy
- Joint-Teams may include members from two companies if:
  - No more than two companies are represented.
  - Neither company has other teams in the same game’s tournament.
  - All standard CEA team rules apply.
  - Joint-Teams may have one captain or two (one per company).
- **Registration**:
  - Two Half-Teams may register as a Joint-Team via the normal process, listing both companies.
  - Half-Teams may consult CEA for pairing assistance and register as a Joint-Team.

### Registration
- Fee: $120.00 per team, paid by the captain during registration on the CEA website. Late registration fee: $150.00.

## III. Match Rules

### Game Mode
- Soccar, 3v3, default settings (no modified mutators).

### Match Winner
- The team winning the most games in the series.

### Series Length
- Regular season: Best-of-five (5).
- Playoffs/elimination: Best-of-seven (7).
- Do not use in-game “Best-Of” features; teams must track progress manually.

### Restrictions
- No restrictions on vehicles or camera settings.
- Standard controllers (including mouse/keyboard) are allowed; macros are prohibited.

### Home/Away Team
- Regular season: Left team on Matchup page is Home; right is Away.
- Playoffs: Higher seed is Home.
- Home team creates the private match lobby and shares details (name/password). Server region must be North America.
  - Regular Season: Home team selects region for the entire match.
  - Playoffs: Home team chooses for games 1–2, Away for games 3–5, Home for games 6–7.

### Roster/Substitutions
- Players may switch between games with no substitution cap. Substitutions should occur between games, except for technical issues.

### Spectator Slots
- Occupied by casters, CEA representatives, or non-playing team members. Spectators may stream but cannot communicate with playing teammates during a game.

### Scheduling/Forfeits
- Matches start at the specified time. Rescheduling follows CEA General Rules; post agreements in Rocket League > #reschedule-and-forfeit on CEA Discord. Forfeits are reported in the same channel.

### Arenas/Map Pool
- Any standard maps. See [Liquipedia Rocket League Wiki](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Portal:Maps).

### Score Reporting
- Report scores via the Match page on [app.playCEA.com](https://app.playcea.com). Goal differentials > ±4 are capped at ±4 (e.g., 9–2 reports as 6–2). Incorrect scores will be adjusted by the Game Lead.

## IV. Technical Issues

### Stoppage of Play Procedure
- Before Game of Record (GOR), a player or teammate may call for a restart for significant issues without opponent agreement, for:
  - Hardware malfunction
  - Physical disruption
  - Software failure/disconnect
  - Extreme circumstances
  - Severe lag (>140 ms ping) if due to a specific server.
- Games may be recreated for these issues. After GOR, restarts require opponent agreement or Game Lead approval.
- Disconnected players may rejoin at any time. If unable to rejoin, a rostered player may join during the game. For the next game, the team may substitute or play shorthanded.
- Server crashes: Game Lead determines next steps.

### General Game Lead Decision Tree
- **No goals scored**: Remake game with full duration.
- **Goals scored**:
  - >3:30 remaining: Remake game, score off kickoffs to restore score, play full game.
  - < 3:30 remaining: Remake game, score off kickoffs to one goal short of original score until ~30s of original time remains, set final score, proceed normally.

### Game of Record (GOR)
- A game is GOR when:
  - All players (typically 6, or fewer for intentional 2v3/2v2) have joined.
  - Game clock has started (< 5:00).
  - A significant event occurs (e.g., a goal scored).
- Before GOR, stop play and restart for serious issues or contact the Game Lead. After GOR, the game is official, and restarts require agreement or Game Lead approval.
